COMMENT: Can a user migrate from 6.3 or earlier?

An upgrade is when an application is moved from one major release to another, for example, from Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.3 to Red Hat JBoss BRMS 6.4. 

Migrations involve moving data and other artifacts to a separate software environment. Migrations usually include upgrades or updates. However, you cannot upgrade from BRMS 6.4 to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}. This guide describes how to migrate from BRMS 6.x to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

.Prerequisites
You have installed {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.

.Procedure
. Migrate KIE projects from BRMS 6.4 to {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
. Migrate the local artifact repository.
. Update the embedded engines.
. Review changes in the engines.
. Upgrade to the new OpenShift images.

[NOTE]
====
KJARS created with Red Hat BRMS 6.x are not supported with {PRODUCT} {PRODUCT_VERSION}.
