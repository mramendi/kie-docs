= Preparing to deploy {PRODUCT} in your OpenShift environment

Before deploying {PRODUCT} in your OpenShift environment, you need to complete several preparatory tasks. You do not need to repeat these tasks if you want to deploy additional images, for example, for new versions of 
ifdef::DM[decision services or for other decision services]
ifdef::PAM[processes or for other processes.]
 

.Prerequisites

* At least four gigabytes of memory are available in the OpenShift environment.
* The OpenShift project for the deployment is created.
* If you intend to scale any of the {KIE_SERVER} pods, your OpenShift environment supports persistent volumes with ReadWriteMany mode.
+
IMPORTANT: ReadWriteMany mode is not supported on OpenShift Online and OpenShift Dedicated.   
. You have logged in to the project using the OpenShift web console and using the `oc` command.
