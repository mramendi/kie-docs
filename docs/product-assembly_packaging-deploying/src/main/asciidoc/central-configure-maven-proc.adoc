= Configuring {CENTRAL} to use an external Maven repository

You can configure {CENTRAL} to use an external Maven repository instead of its built-in repository. In this case, {CENTRAL} pushes all the built KJAR files into this repository. You can progress these files through the repository as necessary to implement your integration process.

IMPORTANT: do not use this procedure for a {CENTRAL} deployed on OpenShift. See ??? fr instructions about configuring {CENTRAL}} onOpenShift, including setting a Maven repository.
