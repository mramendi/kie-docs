= Overview

If you use BRMS version 6.4 or older and install {PRODUCT} version {VERSION}, you need to migrate your existing projects to the new product. 

You can move the applications (now called _decision services_) that you developed using the Business Central workbench to the new equivalent, {CENTRAL}. You do not need to change the underlying code manually to complete this migration. 

Decision services that you developed in Java code (for example, in Eclipse) require modification for {PRODUCT} {VERSION}.
