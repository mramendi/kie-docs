= Authoring environment
You can deploy an environment for creating and modifying processes using {CENTRAL}. It consists {CENTRAL} for the authoring work and {KIE_SERVER} for test execution of the processes.

Depending on your needs, you can deploy either a single authoring environment of a high-availability (HA) authoring environment. 

A single authoring environment contains two pods. One of the pods runs {CENTRAL}, the other runs {KIE_SERVER}. The {KIE_SERVER} includes an embedded H2 database engine. This type of environment uses the least possible amount of resources.

A HA authoring environment contains several pods. Both {CENTRAL} and {KIE_SERVER} are provided in scalable pods that can run in parallel and share persistent storage. The database is provided by a separate high-availability service. Use a high-availability authoring environment to provide maximum reliability and responsiveness, especially if several users are onvolved in authoring at the same time.
