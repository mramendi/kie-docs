= Starting the Order for IT Hardware case

In the Showcase application, start a new case instance for the *IT_Orders* sample case management project in the Showcase application.

Use a case application to add a dynamic task during run time. For demonstration purposes, the {CENTRAL} distribution includes a Showcase application where you can start a new dynamic task or process for the *IT_Orders* project. For more information about installing and running the Showcase application, see {URL_USING_SHOWCASE_APPLICATION}[_{USING_SHOWCASE_APPLICATION}_].
