= Viewing employee shifts

You can view the assigned shifts for particular employees in an employee-centric table. The information is the same as the Shift Roster, but the viewing format might be more convenient for informing employees about their assigned shifts.

.Procedure
. To view a table of employees and shifts, click the *Availability Roster* tab.
. In the top right part of the browser window, the *Week of* field lists the week for which the roster is displayed, To view other weeks, use the *<* and *>* buttons next to the *Week of* field.
. If the list of employees is longer than 10, the numbers of currently visible employees are displayed in the top right part of the browser window, for example, `1-15 of 34`. Use the *<* and *>* buttons next to the numbers to display other employees in the list. 

In the draft period, the borders of boxes representing shifts are dotted lines. In the published periods, the borders are unbroken lines.
