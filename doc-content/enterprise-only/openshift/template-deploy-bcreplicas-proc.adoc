Optionally, you can modify the number of replicas.

Skip this procedure for a single authoring environment.

.Prerequisites

.Procedure

To modify the number of initial replicas in a high-availability authoring environment, set the *KIE Server Container Replicas* (`KIE_SERVER_CONTAINER_REPLICAS`) parameter to the required number.
