= Creating the HA CEP server image

You must prepare the source for the HA CEP server image in order to build the image and deploy it in your OpenShift environment.

.Procedure

. Download the ??? product deliverable file from the {PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_LINK}[Software Downloads] page of the Red Hat Customer Portal.
. Extract the contents of the file.
. Using an IDE, develop the server code based on the project in the `sample-hacep-project/sample-hacep-project-kjar` directory. In partiular, place the Drools language source files in the `src/main/recources/org.drools.cep` subdirectory.
. Build the project using the standard Maven command:
+
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----
+
. _??? A step is needed here to supply the build KJAR file into the Springboot build, so that the build processes can find it - the step is missing from the existing readme_
