= Deploying an additional managed {KIE_SERVER} instance for a freeform environment

:LOCAL_CENTRAL: {CENTRAL} Monitoring

You can add a managed {KIE_SERVER} instance to a freeform environment. This instance can use a PostgreSQL or MySQL database server in a pod or an external database server. 

Deploy the instance in the same project as the {LOCAL_CENTRAL} deployment.

The {KIE_SERVER} loads services from a Maven repository. By default, it starts with no loaded services; you can also configure it to load services at startup. Use {LOCAL_CENTRAL} to deploy, load, and unload services on the server.
