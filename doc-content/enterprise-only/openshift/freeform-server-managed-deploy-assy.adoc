= Deploying an additional managed {KIE_SERVER} instance for a freeform environment

:LOCAL_CENTRAL: {CENTRAL} Monitoring

You can add a managed {KIE_SERVER} instance to a freeform environment. This instance can use a PostgreSQL or MySQL database server in a pod or an external database server. 

Deploy the instance in the same project as the {LOCAL_CENTRAL} deployment.

The {KIE_SERVER} loads services from a Maven repository. By default, it starts with no loaded services. Use {LOCAL_CENTRAL} to deploy and undeploy services on the server. You can also configure the {KIE_SERVER} to load services at startup.
