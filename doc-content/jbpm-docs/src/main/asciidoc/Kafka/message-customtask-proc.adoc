= Adding a custom task that sends {KAFKA} messages 

You can add a `KafkaPublishMessages` custom task to your process. This task sends {KAFKA} messages and supports complicated message workflows, such as executing a Kafka work item and retrieving the results. It does not use the {KIE_SERVER} Kafka capability, so you can use this task in processes that do not run on a {KIE_SERVER}.

.Procedure

. Open the project that contains your business process in {CENTRAL}.
. Select the business process and open the business process designer.
. Add the `KafkaPublishMessages` custom task, available under *Custom Tasks* in the BPMN modeler palette.
. *I was not able to work out the details of what and where to set; despite being present in 7.9 docs, this custom task was not found in 7.9 BC*
