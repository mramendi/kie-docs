// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business rules developer, you can use stateful processing, including Complex Event Processing (CEP), in your code that uses the {DECISION_ENGINE}. You can implement high-availability rule processing with CEP on {OPENSHIFT}.

Standard deployment of {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT}, as described in {URL_DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}[{DEPLOYING_OPENSHIFT_OPERATOR}], supports only stateless processing and therefore is not suitable for high-availability CEP. You must create a custom implementation using the provided reference implementation.

.Prerequisites

* An {OPENSHIFT} environment 4.1 is available and a project is created.
* A Kafka Cluster is deployed in the OpenShift environment with Red Hat AMQ Streams.
* The OpenJDK Java development environment is installed.
* Maven, Docker, and kubectl are installed.
* The `oc` OpenShift command line tool is installed.
