// Purpose statement for the assembly
As a business rules developer, you can use Complex Event Processing (CEP) in your code that uses the {DECISION_ENGINE}. You can implement high-availability rule processing with CEP on {OPENSHIFT}.

Standard deployment of {PRODUCT} on {OPENSHIFT} is not suitable for high-availability CEP. You must create a custom implementation using the provided reference implementation.

.Prerequisites

* An {OPENSHIFT} environment (version 3.11 or 4.1) is available and a project is created.
* A Kafka Cluster is deployed in the OpenShift environment with Red Hat AMQ Streams or with Strimzi https://strimzi.io/
(tested on Openshift 3.11, 4.1 and strimzi 0.11.1, 0.12.1)
* The OpenJDK Java development environment is installed.
* An integrated development environment, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Red Hat JBoss Development Studio is installed.
* Maven, Docker, and kubectl are installed.
* The `oc` OpenShift command line tool is installed.
